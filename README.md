# NYC Bikesharing

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of the this exercise was to analyze the citibike sharing data of NewYork City. We were able to perform several graphical analysis on the data for the month of August in otder to convince the investors that the bikesharing proposal is a lucrative and financially sustainable proposal. 

## Results
1. From visualization 1, we can see that 80% of the bikers are regular suscribers with 20% being one off customers. That signals towards the popularity of biking.
2. From visualization 2, we can see that 7am - 9am and 4pm - 7pm are the busiest time of the day when majority of biking activity takes place. That shows us the peaktimes that we can potentially take advantage of for example increasing fare during those hours etc. 
3. From visualization 3 & 4, we notice that the checkout time of bikers varies significantly by gender. Male bikers dominate this category with majority of bikers checking out for 4-6 hours on average.
4. Visualizaiton 5 shows us how the time of biking varies along the week. During weekdays, most people are working and so the bike traffic is heavy either in the morning before work or in the evening after work. During the weekends, we can see that majority of bikers come out in the middle of day, probably after waking up late. 
5. Visualization 6 discuses the bike timings during the week by gender. We can see that males have a strict timing where they bike before or after work hours on weekday. Females however tend to bike pretty similarly throughout the day except for some who are probably working. 
6. Visualization 7 shows that customer bikers are evenly spread throughout the week but subscribers, especially male subscribers are more prominnent on some days vs others. It also shows that majority of biking is done by subscribers rather than customers.

## Summary
Month of August seem to be a profitable time for bikesharing businesses. NYC is filled with people who bike on a regular basis and the weather plays a big role in the biking traffic. In order to instill more confidence in the investors, we can use tableau to visualize A) biking traffic throughout the year for all months and B) months when the majority of subscriptions take place. These two pieces of information will help the investors narrow down on which month to launch the project in.
